    "content": "Kyoto served as Japan's capital and the emperor's residence from 794 until 1868. It is one of the country's ten largest cities with a population of 1.5 million people and a modern face. One of the most famous temple is {place_0}, not to be mistaken for {place_1}. Over the centuries, Kyoto was destroyed by many wars and fires. Still, due to its exceptional historical value, the city was dropped from the list of target cities for the atomic bomb and escaped destruction during World War II. Countless temples, shrines, and other historically priceless structures survive in the city today. In the middle of the city, temple such as {place_2} and {place_3} are really famous. As the heritage city of Japan, Kyoto is filled with temples and cultural places. Enjoy your trip by bicycle as the city is geographically flat and supports bicycle commuters with numerous bike lanes and parking. {place_4} is one of the temple that can be reached with bicycle just east of the Kyoto city. Going a bit further, there's also a small but significant {place_5} just south of Kyoto-city.",
